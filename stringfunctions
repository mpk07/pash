strcat:
it always assumes that both the strings that are being given as input are null-terminated.
this is why

char stuff[100];
strcat(stuff,"hi ");
strcat(stuff,"there");

fails, but this doesn't?

char stuff[100];
strcpy(stuff,"hi ");
strcat(stuff,"there");

To avoid the possible crash in the first case, it's better to either follow the second approach
or have a stuff[0]='\0'; line before the first strcat() call.
